**KneatWars**

Enter the number of mega light-years to calculate the number of stops needed for each ship in the star wars universe.

**Note** - There is a swapi interface available in npm - https://www.npmjs.com/package/swapi-node. I felt that using this library would probably defeat the purpose of the exercise.

**Getting started**
_npm install_ will install production & development dependencies

_npm test_ - run tests
_npm start_ - run application
_npm run coverage_ - Generate test coverage report, outputs summary to console and report to coverage folder
